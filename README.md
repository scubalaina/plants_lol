# 1. A wicked QIIME2 wiki


There's a million and one tutorials out there for how to use QIIME2. But it's too hard for me to find one that fits my needs. So I'm taking Gandhi's advice and being the change I wish to see in the world. 

This an Alaina-friendly guide to QIIME2 in the form of a wiki with some conditions:
- sequences are already demultiplexed
- primers/adapters have already been removed

You can find the wiki here: https://github.com/scubalaina/plants_lol/wiki/QIIME2-Guide-for-Dumber-Dummies

# 2. A wild R wiki

Again, there's a gazillion and one places to find R tutorials for analyzing OTU count tables for microbiome projects. 

But here's how I wish they were organized:
