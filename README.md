# How to get started with QIIME2 when your samples are already demultiplexed: a wiki.


There's a million and one tutorials out there for how to use QIIME2. But it's too hard for me to find one that fits my needs. So I'm taking Gandhi's advice and being the change I wish to see in the world. 

This an Alaina-friendly guide to QIIME2 in the form of a wiki with some conditions:
- sequences are already demultiplexed
- primers/adapters have already been removed
